# Unnamed-BBC-Micro-Game
BBC micro game written in BeebASM

Early stages, currently only have one level laid out to test and a single ship sprite. 

Collision with anything results in death, a generic sound, and level reset. 

ToDo:
    Ship movement to be gravity based, using left, right, thrust controls. 
    Add some enemies
    Scores
    Lives
    Maybe a timer?
