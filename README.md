# Unnamed-BBC-Micro-Game
BBC micro game written in BeebASM

Early stages, currently only have one level laid out to test and a single ship sprite. 

Collision with anything results in death, a generic sound, and level reset. 

ToDo:
    Add some enemies/collectables
    Scores
    Lives
    Maybe a timer?
    
Added:
    Player Movement (Z - Left; X - Right; * - Thrust)
    Player animation, varies on vertical movement, or death
